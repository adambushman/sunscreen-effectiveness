# Sunscreen Effectiveness

I analyze study results of skin tolerance before and after a sunscreen treatment for 13 patients, evaluating any evidence related to a difference in sunlight tolerance of the groups.

## Description

Skin care is increasingly more important as climate change erodes the atmosphere and the protective ozone layer. Hash sun rays also lead to skin cancer and other dermatological conditions. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the skin tolerance before and with a sunscreen treatment. 

13 patients were studied and their sunlight tolerance in minutes were recorded for the two groups of interest. Our goal is to evaluate whatever evidence we find related to any difference in sunlight tolerance of the groups.

We'll analyze the dataset graphically, make stastically hypotheses/conclusions, evaluate assumptions, and address the scope of inference. You'll find the analysis file (.R) within the repository and a full written report of the findings at the below blog post.
